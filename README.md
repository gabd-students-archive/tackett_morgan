My favorite *medium* length youtube video that everyone should watch is The history of the entire world i guess https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs&t=4s This video is **hilarious**. The video talks about the history of the entire world but in a very *uneducated* sounding way that teaches you a lot but is entertaining enough to watch all **twenty** minutes of.
